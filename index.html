  <h1>ü•ê Croissant</h1>
  <br />
  <p>
    Delightfully crispy outside, perfectly glutenous inside, and each bite packed with buttery
    goodness, nothing tastes like France quite like the croissant. Everyone loves French croissants,
    but how much do you
    know about them? There is A LOT to think about and these facts will have you talking about and
    eating croissants
    from
    dawn until dusk for a good week.The Croissant became the French national product in 1920 and started
    as a luxury
    product,
    but by the end of the
    nineteenth century, it was middle-class (the rich preferred a good brioche).
